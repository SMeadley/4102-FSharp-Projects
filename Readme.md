<h3>Assignments:</h3>

<p><strong>First assignment: Project proposal</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>This is just a proposal for a potential course-long group project that we can use F# to implement. The goal is to learn about a new language and use it to write code functionally similar to some of the code we have already written in other languages, such as Java and C++.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Second assignment: Three basic programs</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>This assignment is meant to help us understand core functionality of the language by creating generic programs with these common themes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Data Structures</li>
    <li>I/O Interaction</li>
    <li>Control Structures</li>
</ul>
